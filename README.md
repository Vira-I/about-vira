#  Vira Ivanova

Hello! 

I am a technical writer with a proven track record and five years of experience documenting software and working with developers. Overall, I have more than 20 years of experience writing for different audiences. 

To learn more about me, see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vira-ivanova-multi/).

## My Work Samples

I work with multiple global companies, most of which keep their documentation private. One of the companies I worked with, however, has its documents publicly available. 

See some of the documents I created for them:


- **A developer guide**: [Setting Up Your Dev Playground](https://dev.arcxp.com/tutorials/quick-start/set-up-your-dev-playground/)
- **A user guide**: [Introduction to Subscription Sales at Arc XP](https://dev.arcxp.com/subscriptions/getting-started/introduction-to-user-subscriptions-at-arc-xpmdx/)
 
  >**Note:**
   >This user guide is for readers with specific technical and account administration background. Terminology and task complexity here are audience-focused.

- **API Documents**:
  - **API service description**: [User-facing APIs for subscription upgrades, downgrades, and renewal adjustments](https://dev.arcxp.com/subscriptions/sales/configure/user-facing-apis-for-subscription-upgrades/).
    >**Note:**
    >In this document, I followed a specific customer's style guide and added some marketing language upon request.

  - **OpenAPI-compliant Swagger file**: [Subscriptions APIs](https://dev.arcxp.com/api/subscriptions-apis/).
    >**Note:**
    >My task for this document was to ensure that it is OpenAPI-compliant.
